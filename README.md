# Starter for katas in JS

This repository's aim is to bring a project initialized with unit testing tools for you to start a coding kata.

## init
``` yarn ``` or ``` npm install ``` 
 

## launch tests
``` yarn test:watch ``` or ``` npm run test:watch ``` 
 
## next steps
Iterate over the following steps:
- in app.spec.js, implement a unit test which describes an expected behaviour ; the test should fail
- in app.js, implement as less code as possible to make it pass
- refactor if needed
